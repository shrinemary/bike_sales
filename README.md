### **📊 Excel Data Processing & Interactive Dashboard**  

#### **📌 Project Overview**  
This project is designed to **automate data processing, create meaningful visualizations, and build an interactive dashboard** using Microsoft Excel. It streamlines the process of cleaning raw data, generating insights, and providing decision-making support through pivot tables and slicers.  

The dashboard allows users to **filter, explore, and analyze key trends** in bike purchases based on various demographic and behavioral attributes.  

---

### **📂 About the Dataset**  
The dataset contains records related to **bike purchases**, including demographic details like gender, age, marital status, education level, profession, and income. It also includes behavioral attributes such as **commute distance and number of children**, helping to analyze how these factors influence purchasing decisions.  

---

### **⚙️ Data Cleaning & Processing Steps**  
To ensure **accuracy and consistency**, the following preprocessing steps were performed:  

1️⃣ **Copy Raw Data** – Creates a duplicate working sheet to preserve the original data.  
2️⃣ **Remove Duplicates** – Ensures a clean dataset by eliminating redundant entries.  
3️⃣ **Find & Replace** – Standardizes categorical values for clarity:  
"m/s" → "Married/Single"   
"m/f" → "Male/Female"  
4️⃣ **Format Income as Currency** – Converts the income column into a currency format for financial clarity.  
5️⃣ **Add Age Bracket Column** – Categorizes individuals based on their age:  
   - `Young` (≤34)  
   - `Middle Age` (35-54)  
   - `Old Age` (55+)  

---

### **📊 Pivot Table Creation for Insights**  
Multiple pivot tables were created to extract **business insights**, focusing on bike purchase trends based on key variables:  

✔ **Gender vs. Avg Income vs. Bike Purchase**  
✔ **Gender vs. Commute Distance vs. Bike Purchase**  
✔ **Age Bracket vs. Bike Purchase**  
✔ **Profession vs. Bike Purchase**  
✔ **Number of Children vs. Bike Purchase**

### **📈 Interactive Dashboard Development**  
The final dashboard consolidates the pivot tables into an interactive report with **slicers and charts**, allowing dynamic data exploration. The following steps were undertaken:  

1️⃣ **Copy all pivot visuals** to a dedicated **Dashboard Sheet**.  
2️⃣ **Remove gridlines** for a clean, professional appearance.  
3️⃣ **Insert slicers** for key filters (Gender, Marital Status, Region, etc.).  
4️⃣ **Connect slicers with all pivot charts** for seamless interaction.  
5️⃣ **Arrange dashboard elements** for clear and intuitive data visualization.
